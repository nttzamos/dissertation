Desktop Python application helping young Greek students (ages 6-12) learn Greek word families. This application was developed in the context of my thesis during my undergraduate studies in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

This work was submitted in 2 Greek conferences and got accepted by both in order to be presented:

1. 26th Pan-Hellenic Conference on Informatics, remote presentation ([conference URL](https://pci2022.uniwa.gr))
2. 3rd Scientific Logotherapy Conference, in-person presentation ([conference URL](https://www.synedrioselle.gr/))

Presenting in the PCI conference resulted in a corresponding [paper publication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3575879.3575992) too.

## Functionality

The developed application supports the Greek language (English translations also exist) and is supposed to be used by teachers, speech therapists or special tutors to aid them in the design of learning activities related to teaching Greek word families to elementary school students.

Basic functionality includes searching for words contained in Greek Elementary-grade schoolbooks in order for their family to be displayed back to the user. Users also have the ability to see their most recent searches as well _star_ words they may face difficulties with in order to easily access them again.

Multipe profiles for different students can be created, as the application is supposed to be used by tutors with many different students. Users can modify the application's appearance and functionality by accessing its settings as well as receive instructions about its usage during its startup.
